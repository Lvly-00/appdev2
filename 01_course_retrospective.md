## 1. What went well

### Activities, Lessons, or Projects I Felt Confident About
I felt most confident with my midterms project. Even though it was my first time working with **ThreeJS** and **GSAP**, I was still able to learn the tools and complete the project successfully. Finishing it gave me confidence in my ability to adapt to new technologies.

### Skills or Concepts I Have Mastered
I believe I have improved my ability to learn unfamiliar frameworks and apply them in a short amount of time. I also gained better confidence in structuring my code and following best practices while developing a project.

## 2. What went wrong / Challenges

### Topics or Tasks That Were Difficult
The most challenging topic for me was **Redux**. Since it was completely new, I was initially confused about how it works and why it is used for state management.

### Obstacles Encountered During Projects or Activities
I did not face major obstacles during activities. However, during the project, **time management** was a challenge because I was learning and developing at the same time. Balancing other subjects and competitions also made the time constraint more difficult.

## 3. Key Learnings

### Technical and Conceptual Takeaways
One of my biggest takeaways from the web development portion of the course is understanding the importance of **Redux**. Although it was difficult to grasp at first, I realized how useful it can be for managing state in larger projects, even if I did not have enough time to fully apply it.

### Technical and Soft Skills
- **Technical Skills:**  
  I learned the importance of avoiding spaghetti code and applying the **DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)** principle to keep code clean and maintainable.
- **Soft Skills:**  
  I learned that clear communication, responsibility, and accountability are essential when working in a team.

## 4. Areas for Improvement

### Skills or Concepts to Focus On
I want to further improve my understanding of both **frontend and backend development**, as becoming a full-stack developer is something I see as necessary in the future. I aim to strengthen my knowledge of how different parts of an application work together—from user interfaces to server-side logic and databases. I also want to gain more hands-on experience by building complete projects, improving my problem-solving skills, and learning how to design scalable and efficient systems.

### Improving Contribution in Team Projects
I can contribute better by managing my time more effectively, communicating progress and concerns clearly, and being more proactive in helping teammates when needed.

## 5. Expectations for Mobile Development (AppDev2)

### Goals for the Course
My goal is to learn more libraries and tools, similar to **Redux**, that can help solve common problems efficiently. I want to be more aware of existing solutions so I can work smarter and reduce unnecessary effort.

### Support or Guidance Needed
With God’s guidance, strong teamwork, and clear instruction from the course, I believe I will be able to stay motivated, keep up with the lessons, and successfully complete the subject.
